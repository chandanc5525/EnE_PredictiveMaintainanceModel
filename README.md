# EnE_PredictiveMaintainanceModel

## Problem Definition

```Predictive maintenance is a critical task in modern industrial operations.Unplanned equipment failures can result in significant downtime, increased costs, and lost productivity. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a machine is likely to fail in the near future based on historical sensor and operational data.This enables organizations to perform maintenance proactively and avoid unexpected breakdowns.```

## Objective
- Build an end-to-end **MLOps-ready pipeline** for predictive maintenance.
- Preprocess raw data including handling of numeric and categorical features.
- Train a robust classifier to predict machine failure.
- Incorporate **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance.
- Track experiments and metrics systematically using **MLflow**.
- Containerize the solution using **Docker** for deployment readiness.

## Model Performance
The RandomForestClassifier was trained on the historical dataset with preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.All experiments, parameters, and metrics are logged and can be reviewed in the MLflow tracking dashboard.

## Effectiveness of the Model

- The model effectively distinguishes between machines that are likely to fail and those that are not.
- It can handle both numerical and categorical data seamlessly via preprocessing pipelines.
- Hyperparameter tuning ensures optimal balance between bias and variance.
- Experiment tracking with MLflow enables reproducibility and continuous improvement.
- The modular, container-ready design supports easy deployment and scaling in production environments.
